# pkghelper

## Installation

You can install the package from Github with

``` r
devtools::install_github("markusdumke/pkghelper")
```

## Usage

Currently the package includes functions which scan the R code in the package
for all packages in use and writes these packages to the Imports field of the 
DESCRIPTION file.

Together with `devtools` and `roxygen2` this package helps to make the R package 
generation process more automatically.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(pkghelper)
# Get names of packages my package depends on
get_dependencies()
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Modify DESCRIPTION
write_dependencies()
```
